# task_views
Local copy for editing CRAN Task Views

This repo contains the Spatial and SpatioTemporal Task View pages in ctv format from the R-Forge **ctv** package, to enable receipt of PRs from those wishing to help keep them up to date. Only TV maintainers can sync them with the R-Forge SVN **ctv** repo. Any PRs should suggest edits to the files in the ctv folder only. The ctv markup format is described in <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ctv/vignettes/ctv-howto.pdf>.
